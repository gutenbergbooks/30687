<h3>THE LORD OF MISRULE</h3>

<div class="quote">
<p >&ldquo;On May days the wild heads of the parish would choose a
Lord of Misrule, whom they would follow even into the church,
though the minister were at prayer or preaching, dancing and
swinging their may-boughs about like devils incarnate.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Old
Puritan Writer.</i></p>
</div>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p class="dropcap">A&nbsp;LL on a fresh May morning, I took my love to church,</p>
<p>To see if Parson Primrose were safely on his perch.</p>
<p>He scarce had got to <i>Thirdly</i>, or squire begun to snore,</p>
    <p class="i2">When, like a sun-lit sea-wave,</p>
      <p class="i3">A green and crimson sea-wave,</p>
<p>A frolic of madcap May-folk came whooping through the door:&mdash;</p>

    <p class="i2 s">Come up, come in with streamers!</p>
      <p class="i3">Come in, with boughs of may!</p>
    <p class="i2">Come up and thump the sexton,</p>
      <p class="i3">And carry the clerk away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>2</span></p>
    <p class="i2 s">Now skip like rams, ye mountains,</p>
      <p class="i3">Ye little hills, like sheep!</p>
    <p class="i2">Come up and wake the people</p>
      <p class="i3">That parson puts to sleep.</p>

<p class="s">They tickled their nut-brown tabors. Their garlands flew in showers,</p>
<p>And lasses and lads came after them, with feet like dancing flowers.</p>
<p>Their queen had torn her green gown, and bared a shoulder as white,</p>
    <p class="i2">O, white as the may that crowned her,</p>
      <p class="i3">While all the minstrels round her</p>
<p>Tilted back their crimson hats and sang for sheer delight:</p>

    <p class="i2 s">Come up, come in with streamers!</p>
      <p class="i3">Come in, with boughs of may!</p>
    <p class="i2">Now by the gold upon your toe</p>
      <p class="i3">You walked the primrose way.</p>
    <p class="i2">Come up, with white and crimson!</p>
      <p class="i3">O, shake your bells and sing;</p>
    <p class="i2">Let the porch bend, the pillars bow,</p>
      <p class="i3">Before our Lord, the Spring!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>3</span></p>
<p class="s">The dusty velvet hassocks were dabbled with fragrant dew.</p>
<p>The font grew white with hawthorn. It frothed in every pew.</p>
<p>Three petals clung to the sexton&rsquo;s beard as he mopped and mowed at the clerk,</p>
    <p class="i2">And &ldquo;Take that sexton away,&rdquo; they cried;</p>
      <p class="i3">&ldquo;Did Nebuchadnezzar eat may?&rdquo; they cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, that was a prize from Betty,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;for kissing her in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="i2 s">Come up, come in with streamers!</p>
      <p class="i3">Come in, with boughs of may!</p>
    <p class="i2">Who knows but old Methuselah</p>
      <p class="i3">May hobble the green-wood way?</p>
    <p class="i2">If Betty could kiss the sexton,</p>
      <p class="i3">If Kitty could kiss the clerk,</p>
    <p class="i2">Who knows how Parson Primrose</p>
      <p class="i3">Might blossom in the dark?</p>

<p class="s">The congregation spluttered. The squire grew purple and all,</p>
<p>And every little chorister bestrode his carven stall.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>4</span></p>
<p>The parson flapped like a magpie, but none could hear his prayers;</p>
    <p class="i2">For Tom Fool flourished his tabor,</p>
      <p class="i3">Flourished his nut-brown tabor,</p>
<p>Bashed the head of the sexton, and stormed the pulpit stairs.</p>

      <p class="i3 s">High in the old oak pulpit</p>
        <p class="i4">This Lord of all misrule&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i3">I think it was Will Summers</p>
        <p class="i4">That once was Shakespeare&rsquo;s fool&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i3">Held up his hand for silence,</p>
        <p class="i4">And all the church grew still:</p>
      <p class="i3">&ldquo;And are you snoring yet,&rdquo; he said,</p>
        <p class="i4">&ldquo;Or have you slept your fill?</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Your God still walks in Eden, between the ancient trees,</p>
<p>Where Youth and Love go wading through pools of primroses.</p>
<p>And this is the sign we bring you, before the darkness fall,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>5</span></p>
    <p class="i2">That Spring is risen, is risen again,</p>
      <p class="i3">That Life is risen, is risen again,</p>
<p>That Love is risen, is risen again, and Love is Lord of all.</p>

      <p class="i3 s">&ldquo;At Paske began our morrice</p>
        <p class="i4">And, ere Pentecost, our May;</p>
      <p class="i3">Because, albeit your words be true,</p>
        <p class="i4">You know not what you say.</p>
      <p class="i3">You chatter in church like jackdaws,</p>
        <p class="i4">Words that would wake the dead,</p>
      <p class="i3">Were there one breath of life in you,</p>
        <p class="i4">One drop of blood,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;<i>He died and He went down to hell!</i> You know not what you mean.</p>
<p>Our rafters were of green fir. Also our beds were green.</p>
<p>But out of the mouth of a fool, a fool, before the darkness fall,</p>
    <p class="i2">We tell you He is risen again,</p>
      <p class="i3">The Lord of Life is risen again,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>6</span></p>
<p>The boughs put forth their tender buds, and Love is Lord of all!&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="i3 s">He bowed his head. He stood so still,</p>
        <p class="i4">They bowed their heads as well.</p>
      <p class="i3">And softly from the organ-loft</p>
        <p class="i4">The song began to swell.</p>
      <p class="i3"><i>Come up with blood-red streamers</i>,</p>
        <p class="i4">The reeds began the strain.</p>
      <p class="i3">The <i>vox humana</i> pealed on high,</p>
        <p class="i4"><i>The Spring is risen again!</i></p>

<p class="s">The <i>vox angelica</i> replied&mdash;<i>The shadows flee away!</i></p>
<p><i>Our house-beams were of cedar. Come in, with boughs of may!</i></p>
<p>The <i>diapason</i> deepened it&mdash;<i>Before the darkness fall</i>,</p>
      <p class="i3"><i>We tell you He is risen again!</i></p>
        <p class="i4"><i>Our God hath burst His prison again!</i></p>
<p><i>Christ is risen, is risen again; and Love is Lord of all.</i></p>

<div class="poemr">

<p class="dropcap">I DREAMED the Eternal had repealed</p>
  <p class="i1">His cosmic code of law last night.</p>
<p>Our prayers had made the Unchanging yield.</p>
  <p class="i1">Caprice was king from depth to height.</p>

<p class="s">On Beachy Head a shouting throng</p>
  <p class="i1">Had fired a beacon to proclaim</p>
<p>Their licence. With unmeasured song</p>
  <p class="i1">They proved it, dancing in the flame.</p>

<p class="s">They quarrelled. One desired the sun,</p>
  <p class="i1">And one desired the stars to shine.</p>
<p>They closed and wrestled and burned as one,</p>
  <p class="i1">And the white chalk grew red as wine.</p>

<p class="s">The furnace licked and purred and rolled,</p>
  <p class="i1">A laughing child held up its hands</p>
<p>Like dreadful torches, dropping gold;</p>

<h3>THE SEARCH-LIGHTS</h3>

<p class="s">And in the land they guard so well</p>
  <p class="i1">Is there no silent watch to keep?</p>
<p>An age is dying, and the bell</p>
  <p class="i1">Rings midnight on a vaster deep.</p>
<p>But over all its waves, once more,</p>
<p>The search-lights move, from shore to shore.</p>

<p class="s">And captains that we thought were dead,</p>

  <p class="i1">The sloth, the intellectual pride;</p>
<p>The trivial jest that veils the goal</p>

<p>The lawless dreams, the cynic Art,</p>
<p>That rend thy nobler self apart.</p>

<p class="s">Not far, not far into the night,</p>

<p>Yet for her faith does England fight,</p>
  <p class="i1">Her faith in this our universe;</p>
<p>Believing Truth and Justice draw</p>
<p>From founts of everlasting law;</p>

<p class="s">Therefore a Power above the State,</p>
  <p class="i1">The unconquerable Power returns.</p>
<p>The fire, the fire that made her great</p>
  <p class="i1">Once more upon her altar burns.</p>
<p>Once more, redeemed and healed and whole,</p>
<p>She moves to the Eternal Goal.</p>

      <p class="i3">And I know not what wild bird</p>

      <p class="i3 s">Will has wealth and wealth to spare.</p>
        <p class="i4">Give him back his own.</p>

<p>There were rusty dusty schooners out of Sunderland,</p>

<p class="s">And to tumble down a hatch into the cabin</p>
  <p class="i1">Was better than the best of broken rules;</p>
<p>For the smell of &rsquo;em was like a Christmas dinner,</p>
  <p class="i1">And the feel of &rsquo;em was like a box of tools.</p>


<p class="s">And, before he went to sleep in the evening,</p>
  <p class="i1">The very last thing that he could see</p>
<p>Was the sailor-men a-dancing in the moonlight</p>
  <p class="i1">By the capstan that stood upon the quay.</p>

<p><i>They caught him, and they caged him, like a squirrel.</i></p>
  <p class="i1"><i>He is totting up accounts, and going grey.</i></p>


<p class="s"><i>He will never, never, never sail to &rsquo;Frisco.</i></p>
  <p class="i1"><i>But the very last thing that he will see</i></p>
<p><i>Will be sailor-men a-dancing in the sunrise</i></p>

<h3>THE RIVER OF STARS</h3>

<p class="center noind">(<i>A tale of Niagara</i>)</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p class="dropcap">T<i>HE lights of a hundred cities are fed by its midnight power.</i></p>
<p><i>Their wheels are moved by its thunder. But they, too, have their hour.</i></p>
<p><i>The tale of the Indian lovers, a cry from the years that are flown,</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>While the river of stars is rolling,</i></p>
      <p class="i3"><i>Rolling away to the darkness,</i></p>
<p><i>Abides with the power in the midnight, where love may find its own.</i></p>

<p class="s">She watched from the Huron tents, till the first star shook in the air.</p>
<p>The sweet pine scented her fawn-skins, and breathed from her braided hair.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>35</span></p>
<p>Her crown was of milk-white blood-root, because of the tryst she would keep,</p>
    <p class="i2">Beyond the river of beauty</p>
      <p class="i3">That drifted away in the darkness</p>
<p>Drawing the sunset thro&rsquo; lilies, with eyes like stars, to the deep.</p>

<p class="s">He watched, like a tall young wood-god, from the red pine that she named;</p>
<p>But not for the peril behind him, where the eyes of the Mohawks flamed.</p>
<p>Eagle-plumed he stood. But his heart was hunting afar,</p>
    <p class="i2">Where the river of longing whispered ...</p>
      <p class="i3">And one swift shaft from the darkness</p>
<p>Felled him, her name in his death-cry, his eyes on the sunset star.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 1.7em; font-size: 150%;">&nbsp;.......</p>

<p class="s">She stole from the river and listened. The moon on her wet skin shone.</p>
<p>As a silver birch in a pine-wood, her beauty flashed and was gone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>36</span></p>
<p>There was no wave in the forest. The dark arms closed her round.</p>
    <p class="i2">But the river of life went flowing,</p>
      <p class="i3">Flowing away to the darkness,</p>
<p>For her breast grew red with his heart&rsquo;s blood, in a night where the stars are drowned.</p>

<p class="s"><i>Teach me, O my lover, as you taught me of love in a day,</i></p>
<p><i>Teach me of death, and for ever, and set my feet on the way,</i></p>
<p><i>To the land of the happy shadows, the land where you are flown.</i></p>
    <p class="i2">&mdash;And the river of death went weeping,</p>
       <p class="i3">Weeping away to the darkness.&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Is the hunting good, my lover, so good that you hunt alone?</i></p>

<p class="s">She rose to her feet like a shadow. She sent a cry thro&rsquo; the night,</p>
<p><i>Sa-sa-kuon</i>, the death-whoop, that tells of triumph in fight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>37</span></p>
<p>It broke from the bell of her mouth like the cry of a wounded bird,</p>
    <p class="i2">But the river of agony swelled it</p>
      <p class="i3">And swept it along to the darkness,</p>
<p>And the Mohawks, couched in the darkness, leapt to their feet as they heard.</p>

<p class="s">Close as the ring of the clouds that menace the moon with death,</p>
<p>At once they circled her round. Her bright breast panted for breath.</p>
<p>With only her own wild glory keeping the wolves at bay,</p>
    <p class="i2">While the river of parting whispered,</p>
      <p class="i3">Whispered away to the darkness,</p>
<p>She looked in their eyes for a moment, and strove for a word to say.</p>

<p class="s"><i>Teach me, O my lover!</i>&mdash;She set her foot on the dead.</p>
<p>She laughed on the painted faces with their rings of yellow and red,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>38</span></p>
<p><i>I thank you, wolves of the Mohawk, for a woman&rsquo;s hands might fail.</i>&mdash;</p>
    <p class="i2">&mdash;And the river of vengeance chuckled,</p>
        <p class="i3">Chuckled away to the darkness,&mdash;</p>
<p><i>But ye have killed where I hunted. I have come to the end of my trail.</i></p>

<p class="s"><i>I thank you, braves of the Mohawk, who laid this thief at my feet.</i></p>
<p><i>He tore my heart out living, and tossed it his dogs to eat.</i></p>
<p><i>Ye have taught him of death in a moment, as he taught me of love in a day.</i></p>
    <p class="i2">&mdash;And the river of passion deepened,</p>
        <p class="i3">Deepened and rushed to the darkness.&mdash;</p>
<p><i>And yet may a woman requite you, and set your feet on the way.</i></p>

<p class="s"><i>For the woman that spits in my face, and the shaven heads that gibe,</i></p>
<p><i>This night shall a woman show you the tents of the Huron tribe.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>39</span></p>
<p><i>They are lodged in a deep valley. With all things good it abounds.</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>Where the red-eyed, green-mooned river</i></p>
      <p class="i3"><i>Glides like a snake to the darkness,</i></p>
<p><i>I will show you a valley, Mohawks, like the Happy Hunting Grounds.</i></p>

<p class="s"><i>Follow!</i> They chuckled, and followed like wolves to the glittering stream.</p>
<p>Shadows obeying a shadow, they launched their canoes in a dream.</p>
<p>Alone, in the first, with the blood on her breast, and her milk-white crown,</p>
    <p class="i2">She stood. She smiled at them, <i>Follow</i>,</p>
      <p class="i3">Then urged her canoe to the darkness,</p>
<p>And, silently flashing their paddles, the Mohawks followed her down.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 1.7em; font-size: 150%;">&nbsp;.......</p>

<p class="s">And now&mdash;-as they slid thro&rsquo; the pine-woods with their peaks of midnight blue,</p>
<p>She heard, in the broadening distance, the deep sound that she knew,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>40</span></p>
<p>A mutter of steady thunder that grew as they glanced along;</p>
    <p class="i2">But ever she glanced before them</p>
      <p class="i3">And glanced away to the darkness,</p>
<p>And or ever they heard it rightly, she raised her voice in a song:&mdash;</p>

<p class="s"><i>The wind from the Isles of the Blesséd, it blows across the foam.</i></p>
<p><i>It sings in the flowing maples of the land that was my home.</i></p>
<p><i>Where the moose is a morning&rsquo;s hunt, and the buffalo feeds from the hand.</i>&mdash;</p>
    <p class="i2">And the river of mockery broadened,</p>
      <p class="i3">Broadened and rolled to the darkness&mdash;</p>
<p><i>And the green maize lifts its feathers, and laughs the snow from the land.</i></p>

<p class="s">The river broadened and quickened. There was nought but river and sky.</p>
<p>The shores were lost in the darkness. She laughed and lifted a cry:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>41</span></p>
<p><i>Follow me! Sa-sa-kuon!</i> Swifter and swifter they swirled&mdash;</p>
    <p class="i2">And the flood of their doom went flying,</p>
      <p class="i3">Flying away to the darkness,</p>
<p><i>Follow me, follow me, Mohawks, ye are shooting the edge of the world.</i></p>

<p class="s">They struggled like snakes to return. Like straws they were whirled on her track.</p>
<p>For the whole flood swooped to that edge where the unplumbed night dropt black,</p>
<p>The whole flood dropt to a thunder in an unplumbed hell beneath,</p>
    <p class="i2">And over the gulf of the thunder</p>
      <p class="i3">A mountain of spray from the darkness</p>
<p>Rose and stood in the heavens, like a shrouded image of death.</p>

<p class="s">She rushed like a star before them. The moon on her glorying shone.</p>
<p><i>Teach me, O my lover</i>,&mdash;her cry flashed out and was gone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>42</span></p>
<p>A moment they battled behind her. They lashed with their paddles and lunged;</p>
    <p class="i2">Then the Mohawks, turning their faces</p>
      <p class="i3">Like a blood-stained cloud to the darkness,</p>
<p>Over the edge of Niagara swept together and plunged.</p>

<p class="s"><i>And the lights of a hundred cities are fed by the ancient power;</i></p>
<p><i>But a cry returns with the midnight; for they, too, have their hour.</i></p>
<p><i>Teach me, O my lover, as you taught me of love in a day,</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>&mdash;While the river of stars is rolling,</i></p>
       <p class="i3"><i>Rolling away to the darkness,&mdash;</i></p>
<p><i>Teach me of death, and for ever, and set my feet on the way!</i></p>

  <p class="i1">But only the night was there.</p>

<p class="s">Nay, out of the formless night, at her furtive glance,</p>
  <p class="i1">Crouched at the end of her cold wet bench, there grew</p>
<p>A bundle of fog, a bundle of rags that, perchance,</p>
  <p class="i1">Once was a woman, too.</p>

<p class="s">A huddled shape, a fungus of foul grey mist</p>
  <p class="i1">Spawned of the river, in peace and much good-will,</p>
<p>And even the woman whose lips had once been kissed</p>
  <p class="i1">Wondered, it crouched so still.</p>

<p class="s">No breath, no shadow of breath in the lamp-light smoked,</p>
  <p class="i1">It crouched so still&mdash;that bunch at the bench&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>She stretched her neck like a crow, then leaned and croaked,</p>
  <p class="i1">&ldquo;<i>A Merry Christmas, friend!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>56</span></p>
<p class="s">She rose, and peered, peered at its vacant eyes.</p>
  <p class="i1">Touched its cold claws. Its arms of knotted bone</p>
<p>Were wands of ice; like iron rods the thighs;</p>
  <p class="i1">The left breast&mdash;like a stone.</p>

<p class="s"><i>Far, far along the rows of warmth and light</i></p>
  <p class="i1"><i>The Christmas waits, with cornet and bassoon,</i></p>
<p><i>Carolled &ldquo;While shepherds watched their flocks by night.&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p class="i1"><i>The bells pealed to the moon.</i></p>

<p class="s">A bundle of rags and bones, a bundle of mist,</p>
  <p class="i1">And never a hell or heaven to hear or see,</p>
<p>The woman, the woman whose lips had once been kissed,</p>
  <p class="i1">Knelt down feverishly.</p>

<p class="s">She plucked the shawl out of that frozen clutch.</p>
 <p class="i1">The dead are dead. Why should the living freeze?</p>
<p>She touched the cold flesh that she feared to touch</p>
 <p class="i1">Kneeling upon her knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>57</span></p>
<p class="s">Her palsied hands unlaced the shoes&mdash;good shoes!&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i1">She tore them quick from the crooked yellow feet.</p>
<p>If Death be generous, why should Life refuse</p>
  <p class="i1">To take, and pawn, and eat?</p>

<p class="s">A heavy step drew nearer thro&rsquo; the mist.</p>
  <p class="i1">She bundled them into the shawl. Her eyes were bright.</p>
<p>The woman, the woman whose lips had once been kissed,</p>
  <p class="i1">Slunk, chuckling, thro&rsquo; the night.</p>

  <p class="i1">Sang thro&rsquo; the old oak-forests of our isle,</p>
<p>Enchanted voice, pure as her falling snow,</p>
  <p class="i1">Dark as her storms, bright as her sunniest smile,</p>
<p>Taliessin, voice of Britain, the fierce flow</p>
  <p class="i1">Of fourteen hundred years has whelmed not thee!</p>
    <p class="i2">Still art thou singing, lavrock of her morn,</p>
<p>Singing to heaven in that first golden glow,</p>
  <p class="i1">Singing above her mountains and her sea!</p>
            <p class="i5">Not older yet are grown</p>
            <p class="i5">Thy four winds in their moan</p>
    <p class="i2">For Urien. Still thy charlock blooms in the billowing corn.</p>

<p class="s">Thy dew is bright upon this beechen spray!</p>
  <p class="i1">Spring wakes thy harp! I hear&mdash;I see&mdash;again,</p>
<p>Thy wild steeds foaming thro&rsquo; the crimson fray,</p>
  <p class="i1">The raven on the white breast of thy slain,</p>
<p>The tumult of thy chariots, far away,</p>
  <p class="i1">The weeping in the glens, the lustrous hair</p>
    <p class="i2">Dishevelled over the stricken eagle&rsquo;s fall,</p>
<p>And in thy Druid groves, at fall of day</p>
  <p class="i1">One gift that Britain gave her valorous there,</p>
            <p class="i5">One gift of lordlier pride</p>
            <p class="i5">Than aught&mdash;save to have died&mdash;</p>
    <p class="i2">One spray of the sacred oak, they coveted most of all.</p>

<div class="pd05">&nbsp;</div>
<h5>III</h5>

<p class="s">I watch thy nested brambles growing green:</p>
  <p class="i1">O strange, across that misty waste of years,</p>
<p>To glimpse the shadowy thrush that thou hast seen,</p>
  <p class="i1">To touch, across the ages, touch with tears</p>
<p>The ferns that hide thee with their fairy screen,</p>
  <p class="i1">Or only hear them rustling in the dawn;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>109</span></p>
    <p class="i2">And&mdash;as a dreamer waking&mdash;in thy words,</p>
<p>For all the golden clouds that drowse between,</p>
  <p class="i1">To feel the veil of centuries withdrawn,</p>
            <p class="i5">To feel thy sun re-risen</p>
            <p class="i5">Unbuild our shadowy prison</p>
    <p class="i2">And hear on thy fresh boughs the carol of waking birds.</p>

<div class="pd05">&nbsp;</div>
<h5>IV</h5>

<p class="s">O, happy voice, born in that far, clear time,</p>
  <p class="i1">Over thy single harp thy simple strain</p>
<p>Attuned all life for Britain to the chime</p>
  <p class="i1">Of viking oars and the sea&rsquo;s dark refrain,</p>
<p>And thine own beating heart, and the sublime</p>
  <p class="i1">Measure to which the moons and stars revolve</p>
    <p class="i2">Untroubled by the storms that, year by year,</p>
<p>In ever-swelling symphonies still climb</p>
  <p class="i1">To embrace our growing world and to resolve</p>
            <p class="i5">Discords unknown to thee,</p>
            <p class="i5">In the infinite harmony</p>
    <p class="i2">Which still transcends our strife and leaves us darkling here.</p>

<p class="s">For, now, one sings of heaven and one of hell,</p>
  <p class="i1">One soars with hope, one plunges to despair!</p>
<p>This, trembling, doubts if aught be ill or well;</p>
  <p class="i1">And that cries, &ldquo;Fair is foul and foul is fair;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this cries, &ldquo;Forward, though I cannot tell</p>
  <p class="i1">Whither, and all too surely all things die;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="i2">And that sighs, &ldquo;Rest, then, sleep and take thine ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One sings his country and one rings its knell,</p>
  <p class="i1">One hymns mankind, one dwarfs them with the sky.</p>
            <p class="i5">O, Britain, let thy soul</p>
            <p class="i5">Once more command the whole,</p>

  <p class="i1">Dust, and her soul foregoes the lesser Cross.</p>

 <p class="i1"> Still, where men simply feel some vague deep loss.</p>
<p>Their hands grope earthward, knowing not what she needs.</p>
  <p class="i1">We would not call her back in this great hour!</p>
    <p class="i2">Nay, upward, onward, to the heights untrod</p>
<p>Signal us, living voices, by those deeds</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>115</span></p>

<div class="pd05">&nbsp;</div>
<h5>XII</h5>

<p class="s">Signal us with that watchword of the deep,</p>
  <p class="i1">The watchword that her boldest seamen gave</p>
<p>The winds of the unknown ocean-sea to keep,</p>
  <p class="i1">When round their oaken walls the midnight wave</p>
<p>Heaved and subsided in gigantic sleep,</p>
  <p class="i1">And they plunged Westward with her flag unfurled.</p>
    <p class="i2">Hark, o&rsquo;er their cloudy sails and glimmering spars,</p>
<p>The watch cries, as they proudly onward sweep,&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i1"><i>Before the world ... All&rsquo;s well!... Before the world</i> ...</p>
              <p class="i5">From mast to calling mast</p>
              <p class="i5">The counter-cry goes past&mdash;</p>

  <p class="i1">He pointed to the dream that still held true.</p>
<p>Cry o&rsquo;er the warring nations, cry as of old</p>
  <p class="i1"><i>A little child shall lead them! they shall be</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>One people under the shadow of God&rsquo;s wing!</i></p>
<p><i>There shall be no more weeping!</i> Let it be told</p>
  <p class="i1">That Britain set one foot upon the sea,</p>
              <p class="i5">One foot on the earth. Her eyes</p>
              <p class="i5">Burned thro&rsquo; the conquered skies,</p>
    <p class="i2">And, as the angel of God, she bade the whole world sing.</p>

<div class="pd05">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="s">A dream? Nay, have ye heard or have ye known</p>
  <p class="i1">That the everlasting God who made the ends</p>
<p>Of all creation wearieth? His worlds groan</p>
  <p class="i1">Together in travail still. Still He descends</p>
<p>From heaven. The increasing worlds are still His throne</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>117</span></p>
  <p class="i1">And His creative Calvary and His tomb</p>
    <p class="i2">Through which He sinks, dies, triumphs with each and all,</p>
<p>And ascends, multitudinous and at one</p>
  <p class="i1">With all the hosts of His evolving doom,</p>
              <p class="i5">His vast redeeming strife,</p>
              <p class="i5">His everlasting life,</p>
    <p class="i2">His love, beyond which not one bird, one leaf can fall.</p>

<div class="pd05">&nbsp;</div>
<h5>XV</h5>

<p class="s">And hark, His whispers thro&rsquo; creation flow,</p>
  <p class="i1"><i>Lovest thou me?</i> His nations answer &ldquo;yea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And&mdash;<i>Feed My lambs</i>, His voice as long ago</p>
  <p class="i1">Steals from that highest heaven, how far away!</p>
<p>And yet again saith&mdash;<i>Lovest thou Me?</i> and &ldquo;O,</p>
  <p class="i1">Thou knowest we love Thee,&rdquo; passionately we cry:</p>
  <p class="i1">But, heeding not our tumult, out of the deep</p>
<p>The great grave whisper, pitiful and low,</p>
  <p class="i1">Breathes&mdash;<i>Feed My sheep</i>; and yet once more the sky</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>118</span></p>
              <p class="i5">Thrills with that deep strange plea,</p>

    <p class="i2">And our lips answer &ldquo;yea&rdquo;; but our God&mdash;<i>Feed My sheep.</i></p>

<h5>XVI</h5>

<p class="s">O sink not yet beneath the exceeding weight</p>
  <p class="i1">Of splendour, thou still single-hearted voice</p>
<p>Of Britain. Droop not earthward now to freight</p>
  <p class="i1">Thy soul with fragments of the song, rejoice</p>
<p>In no faint flights of music that create</p>
  <p class="i1">Low heavens o&rsquo;er-arched by skies without a star,</p>
    <p class="i2">Nor sink in the easier gulfs of shallower pain!</p>
<p>Sing thou in the whole majesty of thy fate,</p>
  <p class="i1">Teach us thro&rsquo; joy, thro&rsquo; grief, thro&rsquo; peace, thro&rsquo; war,</p>
              <p class="i5">With single heart and soul</p>
              <p class="i5">Still, still to seek the goal,</p>
    <p class="i2">And thro&rsquo; our perishing heavens, point us to Heaven again.</p>

<div class="pd05">&nbsp;</div>
<h5>XVII</h5>

<p class="s">Voice of the summer stars that long ago</p>
  <p class="i1">Sang thro&rsquo; the old oak-forests of our isle,</p>
<p>An ocean-music that thou ne&rsquo;er couldst know</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>119</span></p>
  <p class="i1">Storms Heaven&mdash;O, keep us steadfast all the while;</p>
<p>Not idly swayed by tides that ebb and flow,</p>
  <p class="i1">But strong to embrace the whole vast symphony</p>
    <p class="i2">Wherein no note (no bird, no leaf) can fall</p>
<p>Beyond His care, to enfold it all as though</p>
  <p class="i1">Thy single harp were ours, its unity</p>
              <p class="i5">In battle like one sword,</p>
              <p class="i5">And O, its one reward</p>
    <p class="i2">One spray of the sacred oak, still coveted most of all.</p>

  <p class="i1">They heard, as when across a wood a low wind comes,</p>

<p>Bronze and cream-white, and trapped with gold and purple,</p>
  <p class="i1">Towered like tuskéd castles, every thunder-laden footfall</p>
<p>Dreadful as the shattering of a City. Yet they trod,</p>
  <p class="i1">Rocking like an earthquake, to a great triumphant music,</p>
<p>And, swinging like the stars, black planets, white moons,</p>
  <p class="i1">Thro&rsquo; the stream of the torches, they brought the red chariot,</p>
<p>The chariot of the battle-god&mdash;Mars.</p>
  <p class="i1">While the tall spears of Sparta tossed clashing in his train,</p>
<p>And a host of ghostly warriors cried aloud</p>

<p>The red-tongued leopards, and the glory of the god!</p>
  <p class="i1"><i>Iacchus! Iacchus!</i> without dance, without song,</p>

  <p class="i1">Only for a breath when the tumult of their torches</p>
<p>Crimsoned the deep window where that dark warrior stood</p>
  <p class="i1">With the blood upon his mail, and the Queen&mdash;Cleopatra,</p>
<p>Frozen to white marble&mdash;the Mænads raised their timbrels,</p>

  <p class="i1">Lifted their white arms to those twain in the silence</p>
<p>Once, and were gone into the darkness;</p>
  <p class="i1">Once, and away into the darkness they were swept</p>
<p>Like a pageantry of cloud, without praise, without pity.</p>

<p class="dropcap">CRIMSON was the twilight, under that crab-tree,</p>
<p>Where&mdash;old tales tell us&mdash;all a midsummer&rsquo;s night,</p>
<p>A mad young poacher, drunk with mead of elfin-land,</p>
<p>Lodged with the fern-owl, and looked at the stars.</p>

<p class="s">There, from the dusk where the dream of Piers Plowman</p>
<p>Darkens on the sunset, to this dusk of our own,</p>
<p>I read, in a history, the record of our world.</p>

<p class="s">The hawk-moth, the currant-moth, the red-striped tiger-moth</p>
<p>Shimmered all around me, so white shone those pages;</p>
<p>And, in among the blue boughs, the bats flew low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>148</span></p>
<p class="s">I slumbered, the history slipped from my hand.</p>
<p>Then I saw a dead man, dreadful in the moon-dawn,</p>

<p>He muttered as he searched it,&mdash;<i>what vast convulsion</i></p>
<p><i>Mocks my sexton&rsquo;s curse now, shakes our English clay?</i></p>
<p>Whereupon I told him, and asked him in turn</p>
<p>Whether he espied any light in those pages</p>
<p>Which painted an epoch later than his own.</p>
<p><i>I am a shadow</i>, he said, <i>and I see none</i>....</p>

<p><i>I am a shadow</i>, he said, <i>and I see none</i>.</p>

<p class="s">Then, O then he murmured to himself (while the moon hung</p>
<p>Crimson as a lanthorn of Cathay in that crab-tree),</p>
<p>Laughing at his work and the world, as I thought,</p>
<p>Yet with some bitterness, yet with some beauty,</p>
<p>Mocking his own music, these wraiths of his rhymes:</p>

<p class="s">When I see clear what seemed to childish eyes</p>
  <p class="i1">The gorgeous colouring of each pictured age;</p>
<p>And for their dominant tints now recognise</p>
  <p class="i1">Those prints of innocent blood on every page;</p>

<p class="s">O, then I know this world is fast asleep,</p>
  <p class="i1">Bound in Time&rsquo;s womb, till some far morning break;</p>
<p>And, though light grows upon the dreadful deep,</p>

<p class="s">He died, the martyred anarch of his time.</p>
  <p class="i1">What balm is this that consecrates his dust?</p>
<p>The self-same history shudders at the &ldquo;crime&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE YOUNG FRIAR</h3>

<div class="poemr">

<p class="dropcap">WHEN leaves broke out on the wild briar,</p>
  <p class="i1">And bells for matins rung,</p>
<p>Sorrow came to the old friar</p>
  <p class="i1">&mdash;Hundreds of years ago it was!&mdash;</p>
<p>And May came to the young.</p>

<p class="s">The old was ripening for the sky,</p>
  <p class="i1">The young was twenty-four.</p>
<p>The Franklin&rsquo;s daughter passed him by,</p>
  <p class="i1">Reading a painted missal-book,</p>
<p>Beside the chapel door.</p>

<p class="s">With brown cassock and sandalled feet,</p>
  <p class="i1">And red Spring wine for blood;</p>
<p>The very next noon he chanced to meet</p>
  <p class="i1">The Franklin&rsquo;s daughter, in a green May twilight,</p>
<p>Walking through the wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>164</span></p>
<p class="s"><i>Pax vobiscum</i>&mdash;to a maid</p>
  <p class="i1">The crosiered ferns among!</p>
<p>But hers was only the Saxon,</p>
  <p class="i1">And his the Norman tongue;</p>
<p>And the Latin taught by the old friar</p>
  <p class="i1">Made music for the young.</p>

<p class="s">And never a better deed was done</p>
  <p class="i1">By Mother Church below</p>
<p>Than when she made old England one,</p>
  <p class="i1">&mdash;Hundreds of years ago it was!&mdash;</p>
<p>Hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p class="s">Rich was the painted page they read</p>
  <p class="i1">Before that sunset died;</p>
<p>Nut-brown hood by golden head,</p>
  <p class="i1">Murmuring <i>Rosa Mystica</i>,</p>
<p>While nesting thrushes cried.</p>

<p class="s">A Saxon maid with flaxen hair,</p>
  <p class="i1">And eyes of Sussex grey;</p>
<p>A young monk out of Normandy:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i1">&ldquo;May is our Lady&rsquo;s month,&rdquo; he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And O, my love, my May!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>165</span></p>
<p class="s">Then over the fallen missal-book</p>
  <p class="i1">The missel-thrushes sung</p>
<p>Till&mdash;<i>Domus Aurea</i>&mdash;rose the moon</p>
  <p class="i1">And bells for vespers rung.</p>
<p>It was gold and blue for the old friar,</p>
  <p class="i1">But hawthorn for the young.</p>

<p class="s">For gown of green and brown hood,</p>
  <p class="i1">Before that curfew tolled,</p>
<p>Had flown for ever through the wood</p>
  <p class="i1">&mdash;Hundreds of years ago it was!&mdash;</p>
<p>But twenty summers old.</p>

<p class="s">And empty stood his chapel stall,</p>
  <p class="i1">Empty his thin grey cell,</p>
<p>Empty her seat in the Franklin&rsquo;s hall;</p>
  <p class="i1">And there were swords that searched for them</p>
<p>Before the matin bell.</p>

<p class="s">And, crowders tell, a sword that night</p>
  <p class="i1">Wrought them an evil turn,</p>
<p>And that the may was not more white</p>
  <p class="i1">Than those white bones the robin found</p>
<p>Among the roots of fern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>166</span></p>
<p class="s">But others tell of stranger things</p>
  <p class="i1">Half-heard on Whitsun eves,</p>
<p>Of sweet and ghostly whisperings&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i1">Though hundreds of years ago it was&mdash;</p>
<p>Among the ghostly leaves:&mdash;</p>

    <p class="i2"><i>Sero te amavi</i>&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i3">Grey eyes of sun-lit dew!&mdash;</p>
    <p class="i2"><i>Tam antiqua, Tam nova</i>&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i3">Augustine heard it, too.</p>
    <p class="i2">Late have I loved that May, Lady,</p>
      <p class="i3">So ancient, and so new!</p>

<p class="s">And no man knows where they were flown,</p>
  <p class="i1">For the wind takes the may:</p>
<p>But white and fresh the may was blown</p>
  <p class="i1">&mdash;Though hundreds of years ago it was&mdash;</p>
<p>As this that blooms to-day.</p>

<p class="s">And the leaves break out on the wild briar,</p>
  <p class="i1">And bells must still be rung;</p>
<p>But sorrow comes to the old friar,</p>
  <p class="i1">For he remembers a May, a May,</p>
<p>When his old heart was young.</p>

<h3>THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW</h3>

<p class="center noind">(<i>Phi Beta Kappa Poem, Harvard, 1915</i>)</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p class="dropcap">MUSIC is dead. An age, an age is dying.</p>
<p>Shreds of Uranian song, wild symphonies</p>
<p>Tortured with moans of butchered innocents,</p>
<p>Blow past us on the wind. Chaos resumes</p>
<p>His kingdom. All the visions of the world,</p>
<p>The visions that were music, being shaped</p>
<p>By law, moving in measure, treading the road</p>
<p>That suns and systems tread, O who can hear</p>
<p>Their music now? Urania bows her head.</p>
<p>Only the feet that move in order dance.</p>
<p>Only the mind attuned to that dread pulse</p>
<p>Of law throughout the universe can sing.</p>
<p>Only the soul that plays its rhythmic part</p>
<p>In that great measure of the tides and suns</p>
<p>Terrestrial and celestial, till it soar</p>
<p>Into the supreme melodies of heaven,</p>
<p>Only that soul, climbing the splendid road</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>170</span></p>
<p>Of law from height to height, may walk with God,</p>
<p>Shape its own sphere from chaos, conquer death,</p>
<p>Lay hold on life and liberty, and sing.</p>

<p class="s">Yet, since, at least, the fleshly heart must beat</p>
<p>In measure, and no new rebellion breaks</p>
<p>That old restriction, murmurs reach it still,</p>
<p>Rumours of that vast music which resolves</p>
<p>Our discords, and to this, to this attuned,</p>
<p>Though blindly, it responds, in notes like these:</p>

  <p class="i1 s">There was a song in heaven of old,</p>
    <p class="i2">A song the choral seven began,</p>
  <p class="i1">When God with all his chariots rolled</p>
    <p class="i2">The tides of chaos back for man;</p>
  <p class="i1">When suns revolved and planets wheeled,</p>
    <p class="i2">And the great oceans ebbed and flowed,</p>
  <p class="i1">There is one way of life, it pealed,</p>
    <p class="i2">The road of law, the unchanging road.</p>

  <p class="i1 s">The trumpet of the law resounds,</p>
    <p class="i2">And we behold, from depth to height,</p>
  <p class="i1">What glittering sentries walk their rounds,</p>
    <p class="i2">What ordered hosts patrol the night,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>171</span></p>
  <p class="i1">While wheeling worlds proclaim to us,</p>
    <p class="i2">Captained by Thee thro&rsquo; nights unknown,&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i1"><i>Glory that would be glorious</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>Must keep Thy law to find its own.</i></p>

  <p class="i1 s">Beyond rebellion, past caprice,</p>
    <p class="i2">From heavens that comprehend all change,</p>
  <p class="i1">All space, all time, till time shall cease,</p>
    <p class="i2">The trumpet rings to souls that range,</p>
  <p class="i1">To souls that in wild dreams annul</p>
    <p class="i2">Thy word, confessed by wood and stone,&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i1"><i>Beauty that would be beautiful</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>Must keep Thy law to find its own.</i></p>

  <p class="i1 s">He that can shake it, will he thrust</p>
    <p class="i2">His careless hands into the fire?</p>
  <p class="i1">He that would break it, shall we trust</p>
    <p class="i2">The sun to rise at his desire?</p>
  <p class="i1">Constant above our discontent,</p>
    <p class="i2">The trumpet peals in sterner tone,&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i1"><i>Might that would be omnipotent</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>Must keep Thy law to find its own.</i></p>

  <p class="i1 s">Ah, though beneath unpitying spheres</p>
    <p class="i2">Unreckoned seems our human cry,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>172</span></p>
  <p class="i1">In Thy deep law, beyond the years,</p>
    <p class="i2">Abides the Eternal memory.</p>
  <p class="i1">Thy law is light, to eyes grown dull</p>
    <p class="i2">Dreaming of worlds like bubbles blown;</p>
  <p class="i1"><i>And Mercy that is merciful</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>Shall keep Thy law and find its own.</i></p>

  <p class="i1 s">Unchanging God, by that one Light</p>
    <p class="i2">Through which we grope to Truth and Thee,</p>
  <p class="i1">Confound not yet our day with night,</p>
    <p class="i2">Break not the measures of Thy sea.</p>
  <p class="i1">Hear not, though grief for chaos cry</p>
    <p class="i2">Or rail at Thine unanswering throne.</p>
  <p class="i1"><i>Thy law, Thy law, is liberty,</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>And in Thy law we find our own.</i></p>

<p class="s">So, to Uranian music, rose our world.</p>
<p>The boughs put forth, the young leaves groped for light.</p>
<p>The wild flower spread its petals as in prayer.</p>
<p>Then, for terrestrial ears, vast discords rose,</p>
<p>The struggle in the jungle, clashing themes</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>173</span></p>
<p>That strove for mastery; but above them all,</p>
<p>Ever the mightier measure of the suns</p>
<p>Resolved them into broader harmonies,</p>
<p>That fought again for mastery. The night</p>
<p>Buried the mastodon. The warring tribes</p>
<p>Of men were merged in nations. Wider laws</p>
<p>Embraced them. Man no longer fought with man,</p>
<p>Though nation warred with nation. Hatred fell</p>
<p>Before the gaze of love. For in an hour</p>
<p>When, by the law of might, mankind could rise</p>
<p>No higher, into the deepening music stole</p>
<p>A loftier theme, a law that gathered all</p>
<p>The laws of earth into its broadening breast</p>
<p>And moved like one full river to the sea,</p>
<p>The law of Love.</p>
<p>The sun stood dark at noon;</p>
<p>Dark as the moon before this mightier Power,</p>
<p>And a Voice rang across the blood-stained earth:</p>
<p><i>I am the Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light.</i></p>
<p>We heard it, and we did not hear. In dreams</p>
<p>We caught a thousand fragments of the strain,</p>
<p>But never wholly heard it. We moved on</p>
<p>Obeying it a little, till our world</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>174</span></p>
<p>Became so vast, that we could only hear</p>
<p>Stray notes, a golden phrase, a sorrowful cry,</p>
<p>Never the rounded glory of the whole.</p>
<p>So one would sing of death, one of despair,</p>
<p>And some, knowing that God was more than man,</p>
<p>Knowing that the Eternal Power behind</p>
<p>Our universe was more than man, would shrink</p>
<p>From crowning Him with human attributes,</p>
<p>Though these remained the highest that we knew;</p>
<p>And therefore, falling back on lower signs,</p>
<p>Bereft of love, thought, personality,</p>
<p>They made Him less than man; made Him a blind</p>
<p>Unweeting force, less than the best in man,</p>
<p>Less than the best that He Himself had made.</p>

<p class="s">Yet, though from earth we could no longer hear</p>
<p>As from a central throne, the harmonies</p>
<p>Of the revolving whole; yet though from earth,</p>
<p>And from earth&rsquo;s Calvary, the central scene</p>
<p>Withdrew to dreadful depths beyond our ken;</p>
<p>Withdrew to some deep Calvary at the heart</p>
<p>Of all creation; yet, O yet, we heard,</p>
<p>Echoes that murmured from Eternity,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>175</span></p>
<p><i>I am the Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light.</i></p>
<p>And still the eternal passion undiscerned</p>
<p>Moved like a purple shadow through our world,</p>
<p>While we, in intellectual chaos, raised</p>
<p>The ancient cry, <i>Not this man, but Barabbas.</i></p>
<p>Then Might grew Right once more, for who could hold</p>
<p>The Right, when the rebellious hearts of men</p>
<p>Finding the Law too hard in life, thought, art,</p>
<p>Proclaimed that Right itself was born of chance,</p>
<p>Born out of nothingness and doomed, at last,</p>
<p>To nothingness; while all that men have held</p>
<p>Better than dust&mdash;love, honour, justice, truth&mdash;</p>
<p>Was less than dust, for the blind dust endures?</p>
<p>But love, they said, and the proud soul of man,</p>
<p>Die with the breath, before the flesh decays.</p>
<p>And still, amidst the chaos, Love was born,</p>
<p>Suffered and died; and in a myriad forms</p>
<p>A myriad parables of the Eternal Christ</p>
<p>Unfolded their deep message to mankind.</p>
<p>So, on this last wild winter of his birth,</p>
<p>Though cannon rocked his cradle, heaven might hear,</p>
<p>Once more, the Mother and her infant Child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>176</span></p>
  <p class="i1 s"><i>Will the Five Clock-Towers chime tonight?</i></p>
    <p class="i2">&mdash;Child, the red earth would shake with scorn.&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i1"><i>But will the Emperors laugh outright</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>If Roland rings that Christ is born?</i></p>

  <p class="i1 s">No belfries pealed for that pure birth.</p>
    <p class="i2">There were no high-stalled choirs to sing.</p>

  <p class="i1 s"><i>Is there no peace, then, anywhere?&mdash;</i></p>
    <p class="i2">Perhaps, where some poor soldier lies</p>
  <p class="i1">With all his wounds in front, out there.&mdash;</p>
    <p class="i2"><i>You weep?</i>&mdash;He had your innocent eyes.&mdash;</p>

  <p class="i1 s"><i>Then is it true that Christ&rsquo;s a slave,</i></p>
    <p class="i2"><i>Whom all these wrongs can never rouse?&mdash;</i></p>
  <p class="i1">They said it. But His anger drave</p>
    <p class="i2">The money-changers from His House.&mdash;</p>

  <p class="i1 s"><i>Yet He forgave and turned away.&mdash;</i></p>
    <p class="i2">Yes, unto seventy times and seven.</p>
  <p class="i1">But they forget. He comes one day</p>
    <p class="i2">In power, among the clouds of heaven.&mdash;</p>

  <p class="i1 s"><i>Then Roland rings?</i>&mdash;Yes, little son!</p>
    <p class="i2">With iron hammers they dare not scorn,</p>
  <p class="i1">Roland is breaking them, gun by gun,</p>
    <p class="i2">Roland is ringing. Christ is born.</p>

<p class="s">Born and re-born; for though the Christ we knew</p>
<p>On earth be dead for ever, who shall kill</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>178</span></p>
<p>The Eternal Christ whose law is in our hearts,</p>
<p>Christ, who in this dark hour descends to hell,</p>
<p>And ascends into heaven, and sits beside</p>
<p>The right hand of the Father. If for men</p>
<p>This law be dead, it lives for children still.</p>
<p>Children that men have butchered see His face,</p>
<p>Rest in His arms, and strike our mockery dumb.</p>
<p>So shall the trumpet of the law resound</p>
<p>Through all the ages, telling of that child</p>
<p>Whose outstretched arms in Belgium speak for God.</p>

  <p class="i1 s">They crucified a Man of old,</p>
    <p class="i2">The thorns are shrivelled on His brow.</p>
  <p class="i1">Prophet or fool or God, behold,</p>
    <p class="i2">They crucify Thy children now.</p>
  <p class="i1">They doubted evil, doubted good,</p>
    <p class="i2">And the eternal heavens as well,</p>
  <p class="i1">Behold, the iron and the blood,</p>
    <p class="i2">The visible handiwork of Hell.</p>

  <p class="i1 s">Fast to the cross they found it there,</p>
    <p class="i2">They found it in the village street,</p>
  <p class="i1">A naked child, with sunkissed hair.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>179</span></p>
    <p class="i2">The nails were through its hands and feet.</p>
  <p class="i1">For Christ was dead, yes, Christ was dead!</p>
    <p class="i2">O Lamb of God, O little one,</p>
  <p class="i1">I kneel before your cross instead</p>
    <p class="i2">And the same shadow veils the sun....</p>

    <p class="i2 s">And the same shadow veils the sun....</p>

<p class="s">But you, O land, O beautiful land of Freedom,</p>
<p>Hold fast the faith which made and keeps you great.</p>
<p>With you, with you abide the faith and hope,</p>
<p>In this dark hour, of agonised mankind.</p>
<p>Hold to that law whereby the warring tribes</p>
<p>Were merged in nations, hold to that wide law</p>
<p>Which bids you merge the nations, here and now,</p>
<p>Into one people. Hold to that deep law</p>
<p>Whereby we reach the peace which is not death</p>
<p>But the triumphant harmony of Life,</p>
<p>Eternal Life, immortal Love, the Peace</p>
<p>Of worlds that sing around the throne of God.</p>

<p class="dropcap">THUS only should it come, if come it must&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i1">Not with a riot of flags and a mob-born cry,</p>
  <p class="i1">But with a noble faith, a conscience high</p>
<p>That, if we fail, we failed not in our trust.</p>
<p>We fought for peace. We dared the bitter thrust</p>
  <p class="i1">Of calumny for peace, and watched her die,</p>
  <p class="i1">Her scutcheons rent from sky to outraged sky</p>
<p>By felon hands and trampled into the dust.</p>

<p class="s">We proffered justice, and we saw the law</p>
  <p class="i1">Cancelled by stroke on stroke of those deft hands</p>
    <p class="i2">Which still retain the imperial forger&rsquo;s pen.</p>
<p>They must have blood&mdash;Then, at this last, we draw</p>
  <p class="i1">The sword, not with a riot of flags and bands,</p>
    <p class="i2">But silence, and a mustering of men.</p>

<p class="s">They challenge Truth. A people makes reply,</p>
  <p class="i1">East, West, North, South, one honour and one might,</p>
  <p class="i1">From sea to sea, from height to war-worn height,</p>
<p>The old word rings out&mdash;to conquer or to die.</p>
<p>And we shall conquer! Though their eagles fly</p>
  <p class="i1">Through heaven, around this ancient isle unite</p>
  <p class="i1">Powers that were never vanquished in the fight,</p>
<p>The unconquerable Powers that cannot lie.</p>

<p class="s">Though fire destroy her flesh, and many a year</p>
  <p class="i1">This land forgot the faith that made her great,</p>
    <p class="i2">Now, as her fleets cast off the North Sea foam,</p>
<p>Casting aside all faction and all fear,</p>
  <p class="i1">Thrice-armed in all the majesty of her fate,</p>
    <p class="i2">Britain remembers, and her sword strikes home.</p>

<h3>THE SONG-TREE</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p class="dropcap">GROW, my song, like a tree,</p>
  <p class="i1">As thou hast ever grown,</p>
<p>Since first, a wondering child,</p>
  <p class="i1">Long since, I cherished thee.</p>
<p>It was at break of day,</p>
  <p class="i1">Well I remember it,&mdash;</p>
<p>The first note that I heard,</p>
  <p class="i1">A magical undertone,</p>
<p>Sweeter than any bird</p>
  <p class="i1">&mdash;Or so it seemed to me&mdash;</p>
<p>And my tears ran wild.</p>
  <p class="i1">This tale, this tale is true.</p>
<p>The light was growing gray;</p>
  <p class="i1">And the rhymes ran so sweet</p>
<p>(For I was only a child)</p>
  <p class="i1">That I knelt down to pray.</p>

<p class="s">Grow, my song, like a tree.</p>
  <p class="i1">Since then I have forgot</p>
  <p class="i1">A thousand friends, but not</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>183</span></p>
<p>The song that set me free,</p>
  <p class="i1">So that to thee I gave</p>
<p>My hopes and my despairs,</p>
  <p class="i1">My boyhood&rsquo;s ecstasy,</p>
<p>My manhood&rsquo;s prayers.</p>
  <p class="i1">In dreams I have watched thee grow,</p>
<p>A ladder of sweet boughs,</p>
  <p class="i1">Where angels come and go,</p>
<p>And birds keep house.</p>
  <p class="i1">In dreams, I have seen thee wave</p>
<p>Over a distant land,</p>
  <p class="i1">And watched thy roots expand,</p>
<p>And given my life to thee,</p>
  <p class="i1">As I would give my grave.</p>

<p class="s">Grow, my song, like a tree,</p>
  <p class="i1">And when I am grown old,</p>
<p>Let me die under thee,</p>
  <p class="i1">Die to enrich thy mould;</p>
<p>Die at thy roots, and so</p>
  <p class="i1">Help thee to grow.</p>
<p>Make of this body and blood</p>
  <p class="i1">Thy sempiternal food.</p>
<p>Then let some little child,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>184</span></p>
  <p class="i1">Some friend I shall not see,</p>
<p>When the great dawn is gray,</p>
  <p class="i1">Some lover I have not known,</p>
<p>In summers far away,</p>
  <p class="i1">Sit listening under thee.</p>
<p>And in thy rustling hear</p>
  <p class="i1">That mystical undertone,</p>
<p>Which made my tears run wild,</p>
  <p class="i1">And made thee, O, how dear.</p>

<p class="s">In the great years to be?</p>
  <p class="i1">I am proud then? Ah, not so.</p>
<p>I have lived and died for thee.</p>
  <p class="i1">Be patient Grow.</p>

<p>Grow, my song, like a tree.</p>
